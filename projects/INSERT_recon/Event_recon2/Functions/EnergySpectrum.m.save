function [ Energy ] = EnergySpectrum( Frame , depict )
%% This function computes and dislays the energy spectrum of the acquired data 
%   The energy of the gamma ray that produces a single scintillation event is 
%   computed as the sum of the signals related to all the readout
%   channels. The energy spectrum is the histogram of the energy
%   distribution for all the events that are present in the dataset
%   (Frame). This is dispayed if "depict" is set to "1".

%Energy for each of the acquired events is computed
Energy = sum(Frame,2);

%Energy histogram is computed (the number of bins is equal to the
%sqrtof number of acquired events
[y,x]=hist(Energy,floor(sqrt(size(Frame,1))));

%The histogram is plotted: on the x-axis the energy amplitude is expressed
%in ADC-channels
